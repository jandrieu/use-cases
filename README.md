# Use-cases & Requirements
The purpose of this repo is to document and solicit community feedback on the canonical use-cases and requirements for Interchain NFTs + Metadata.

These contributions are intended to support the InterNFT Working Group to identify technical requirements for developing an interface standard for Interchain NFTs and an Interchain Metadata Standard for NFT referent resources. Recommendations in these standards will be sense-checked against the use-cases and requirements.

The [Use Cases and Requiremenents](https://github.com/interNFT/use-cases/blob/main/NFT-RFC-002-use-cases.md) Working Draft (NFT-RFC-002) is a living document which is expected to evolve with further contributions, improvements and the addition of new use cases, examples and user stories.
